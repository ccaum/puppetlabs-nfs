#  NFS Puppet Module

Carl Caum <carl@puppetlabs.com>

This module manages NFS and provides types to manage exports

classes:

nfs::config - Parameterized class that alters the default behavior of the module

	Parameters:
		* header: The header of the exports file, where applicable
		* work_directory: Where the module stores its work files
		* file_owner: The owner of the work files
		* file_group: The group of the work files
		* linux_package: The package to install on linux systems
		* linux_pacakge_version: The version of the package to install on linux systems
		* nfs_service: The name of the NFS service to manage

	class { 'nfs::config':
		header      => 'Custom Header':
		nfs_service => nfsd,
	}

nfs::disable - Disables the NFS service

	include nfs::disable


defined types:

nfs::export - Sets an export resource for export hosts to assign themselves to

	Parameters:
		* export: [default: namevar] The directory to export
		* manage_directory: [default: false] Whether to manage the directory being exported

	nfs::export { '/export/myexport': }

nfs::exporthost:
	Parameters:
		* export: The export the host is to be associated with. Cannot be an array
		* parameters: [default: ro,subtree_check] The export parameters
		* host: [default: namevar] The host to assign to export
		* subnet: [optional] The subnet to assign to the host

	nfs::exporthost { 'hosta':
		export     => '/export/myexport',
		parameters => ['rw','no_root_squash'],

CAVEATS:

	Linux:
		If a nfs::export resource is defined, but no nfs::exporthost resources use it, 
			Linux will export the directory to any host
